=============================

Mod for Minecraft which adds some tools to make wandering the world more enjoyable

This mod is meant to stay close to vanilla minecraft and add simple tools which make 
it easier for players to wander the world without having to stop and setup a large 
number of facilities. Features added to this mod will be constrained to those 
furthering this goal (but other fun ideas might rate a new, separate mod!)

Note that several Minecraft Forge files are required in addition to those uploaded to
the repository. The files in the repository should be dropped into a unpacked forge 
directory
